FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.Modificator : "Mod"
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.Modificator.Description : """
    The good old `Mod` key, just like LW normally uses it. But this one applies to CWP only.
    
    Main usage: When releasing `DrawWire` key while holding `Mod` CWP goes into a stall state, where you can modify your group or start a new one. Also part of the vanilla MWP.
    
    And that is already all usage. Any more feature here, and the usage of CWP would become much more complicated.   
    The primary advantage is, that one can keep the `Mod` key easily held. Which makes it quite comfortable to use.
    
    (In case you wonder, mods cannot set meta keys yet - at least not in an obvious way).
    """
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.ModificatorAlternative: "Alt"
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.ModificatorAlternative.Description: """
    An alternative mod key.
    
    Since the normal `Mod` key, would easily become way to complicated to use, the `Alt` modifier contains all remaining features.  
    `Alt` is always used in a way, that you never need to hold it, it only leads as a Modifier when using the mouse-wheel or pressing or releasing a key.  
    By design you can set the `Alt` key to be the same key as `Mod`, but that is very difficult to use.
    
    List of features using `Alt`:
    - When holding `Alt`, while clicking the very first peg of CWP, you can draw a peg with a wire connected to the starting peg. Good for free-form placement.
    - When holding `Alt` and one of the two `Expand` keys, the mouse wheel allows expanding by 1 peg, or even removing one expanded peg.
    - When holding `Alt`, when using `DrawWire` in stall mode, it will not start a new group, but white or blacklist pegs.<br>Blacklist pegs will be ignored, regardless of where in the group they are. While whitelisted pegs will be appended to the list of pegs (wires connect to it last).<br>If a peg was selected it becomes blacklisted, else whitelisted.

FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.ApplyNormalAction : "Apply default action"
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.ApplyNormalAction.Description: """
    Will apply the normal building action, as if you did not enter the stall mode.
    
    For one group, this is connecting all pegs in a row, for two groups it is connecting them with each other.
    """
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.ExpandFurther: "Expand forwards"
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.ExpandFurther.Description: """
    Once two pegs are selected, one can expand in that direction 'upwards'.
    
    Each press of this key will try to detect another section of pegs and add it.
    
    When holding `Alt` while pressing this key and using the mouse-wheel, you can expand by 1 or remove the last discovered peg again.
    """
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.ExpandBackwards: "Expand backwards"
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.ExpandBackwards.Description: """
    Once two pegs are selected, one can expand in that direction 'downwards'.
    
    Each press of this key will try to detect another section of pegs and add it.
    
    When holding `Alt` while pressing this key and using the mouse-wheel, you can expand by 1 or remove the last discovered peg again.

FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.Flip: "Flip"
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.Flip.Description: """
    Flip the order of the second group, so that the wires are connected the other way round.
    """
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.RemoveWires: "Remove wires"
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.RemoveWires.Description: """
    When only one group is selected, it removes all wires from the selected pegs.  
    With two groups it removes the wires in between these two groups.
    
    It does not terminate CWP, to allow further actions with the same group (Good for replacing wires in a different way).
    """
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.ApplyPattern: "Apply pattern"
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.ApplyPattern.Description: """
    Attempts to apply the pattern of pegs of the first group with the first peg of it as origin onto the second group.  
    Here the first peg of that group will be the new origin.
    
    The pattern will not get rotated or modified.  
    When already holding 'DrawWire', then the pattern applies immediately.

FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.SkipModeSwitch: "Switch skip mode"
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.SkipModeSwitch.Description: """
    Switches between `Skip N pegs and select 1 peg` and `Skip N pegs and select N pegs` modes.
    
    Check the settings, to further customize the skipping.
    """
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.GoTwoDimensional: "Switch to 2D group"
FancyInput.Trigger.CustomWirePlacer.GoTwoDimensional.Description: """
    Toggles the 2D mode.  
    Once enabled, the next `DrawWire` action is treated as the second axis for the current (now 2D) group.
    
    The first axis are selected pegs. The second axis only defines the offsets.  
    Each offset (vector from a peg to the next one), of the second axis, will be added to the pegs from the first axis.  
    This way a grid can be constructed. It does not matter where the second axis is, as long as the offsets match.
    
    If you have 1-group MWP enabled, the wires will be connected along the second axis (each peg of the first axis, is part of its own wire).
