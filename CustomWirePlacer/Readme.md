### Description:

`Logic World` introduced an amazing feature called Multi-Wire-Placer. But could there be something even more powerful?

Reasons for creation of this mod:

- Often one wants to connect pegs in a row. Connecting `1 to N` with `0 to N-1` takes a bit of flying and is easy to mess up.
- The beta-testers already struggled with connecting a 2D field of pegs with another 2D field.
- Sometimes you just want to create a wire to a new peg over a longer distance.

This mod provides a full rework of the vanilla wire-placement, it literally replaces it.\
It provides a lot of new features and possibilities, and will with a very high chance speed up your wire connecting.

## Install / Dependencies:

Just drop the `CustomWirePlacer` folder into your `GameData` folder.

You will also need the two mods `EccsGuiBuilder` and `EccsLogicWorldAPI` for this mod to function.\
You can find them in my mod collection (root folder).

## Usage:

After installed, you can keep using the wire-placer as before. However, it uses different outline colors, and has new overlays open by default.

The mod itself comes with a built-in help, which should show you every little feature that CWP provides. It is by default turned ON.

To configure CWP, you will need to start a wire-placement operation (click a peg) and then press the settings key `H`.\
In there you can turn off the overlays and even reset every setting.

To uninstall this mod, just remove the files for it. However, its setting are stored in the `Menu Settings` folder by `Logic World` itself.

# DO NOT MISUSE THIS MOD:

The 2D feature if combined with the whitelist feature, can cause duplicated/invalid wires if abused.\
If you do not understand these features, do not use them - or learn how to use them.

^Note at self: Is this still the case? Sounds suspicious. Iirc I have code to prevent duplicated wires...
