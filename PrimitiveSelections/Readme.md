# Primitive Selections

### Description:

Provides a feature to select all child components of a component or a selection of components. Will replace the previous selection with the new one.

Reason for creation of this mod:

- `Logic World` only provides a very simple multi selection feature, it is super tedious to select many components. The current selection is easily lost.
- A player mentioned an idea to simply select all child components for a board. I was like: "Hey that is super easy to add!". Few days later this plugin was created.

There could be many more advanced features, but this mod only provides a primitive selection feature.

## Install / Dependencies:

Just drop the `PrimitiveSelections` folder into your `GameData` folder.

## Usage:

This mod adds a new Building Operation.

You can use that Building Operation via the Action Wheel while looking at a component or while having component selected.\
Building Operations can be triggered via keybinding, by default this mod does not set a default keybinding. You can set one yourself in the keybinding setting. Just search for the header `Mod: Primtive Selections`.
