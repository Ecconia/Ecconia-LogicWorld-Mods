# FixClientMods by @Ecconia

### Description:

Will fix some bugs, that MHG was not able to fix because they are too busy improving the game elsewhere.

Currently fixes the following:
- Exception/crash when undoing a Component after it was placed and its custom data edited.
- Exception/crash after copying multi-selected components with wires.

## Install / Dependencies:

Just drop the `FixClientMods` folder into your `GameData` folder.

You will also need the two mods `HarmonyForLogicWorld` and `AssemblyLoader` for this mod to function.\
You can find them in my mod collection (root folder).
