# WorldSaver by @Ecconia

### Description:

Allows you to download multi-player worlds.

This mod is written for my own usage - do not expect everything to work.

It will download the world type and all locally available custom data.\
Keep in mind, that due to an LW bug, the internal counter of Delayers cannot be saved.\
Also absolutely no guarantee that modded components custom data is saved properly.

The command `saveworld` will save the world into your `saves` folder with the name `WorldExport`, make sure to rename the folder.

## Install / Dependencies:

Just drop the `WorldSaver` folder into your `GameData` folder.

For this mod to function you will need one additional mod: `EccsLogicWorldAPI`\
You can find it in my mod collection (root folder).
