# WorldSaver by @Ecconia

### Description:

Allows you to download multiplayer worlds.

This mod is written for my own usage - do not expect everything to work.

It will download the world type and all locally available custom data.\
Also absolutely no guarantee that modded components custom data is saved properly.\
Best is, if you pause the simulation - then wait for the server to save - then rejoin - then download. As then custom data and ExtraData is up-to-date on your client.

The command `saveworld` will save the world into your `saves` folder with the name `WorldExport`, make sure to rename the folder.

## Install / Dependencies:

Just drop the `WorldSaver` folder into your `GameData` folder.

For this mod to function you will need one additional mod: `EccsLogicWorldAPI`\
You can find it in my mod collection (root folder).
