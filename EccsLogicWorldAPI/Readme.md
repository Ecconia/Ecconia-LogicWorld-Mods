# EccsLogicWorldAPI by @Ecconia

A library mod that does nothing on its own.\
It provides useful tools and accessors for other mods to use.

## Contribution?

It is written for mods by Ecconia, however anyone is free to use it.\
And if you use some LW-hack a lot in multiple of your mods, feel free to add it to this mod.\
In the ideal case we have one big chunky API mod that is helpful for every modder.

## Install / Dependencies:

Just drop the `EccsLogicWorldAPI` folder into your `GameData` folder.

You might have to install `HarmonyForLogicWorld` to make use of some features. But you will be instructed to by the mod using this API.
